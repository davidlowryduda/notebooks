<LI>The following table is believed to exhibit all first occurrence
    and maximal prime gaps conclusively established as of the date
    shown above. In addition, all first known occurrence gaps, less
    than 2000 in measure, are shown. A supplemental table exhibits
    all other prime gaps (<U>not</U> first occurrences), 1000 or
    greater in measure, lying below 5e16.</LI>
<LI>More precisely, the tables include all such gaps known to me, and
    which I have been able to verify (to the extent practical), process,
    format, and post. Values for which no such gap is available are
    indicated by a missing entry.</LI>
<LI>All prime gaps in 0 &lt; x &lt; 9.25e18 have now been analyzed.
    The upper bound of exhaustive analysis of gaps has been extended
    successively, as follows. For the most recent results, see the
    <A HREF="http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=22187">
    Prime Gap Searches</A> project at the Mersenne Forum (see

    Where two dates are given, the earlier one is the date of completion
    of computations for that interval; the later date is the point
    at which all other integers below that interval had also been
    exhaustively checked. See the <A HREF="#Bib">bibliography</A>
    below for full names and attribution.</LI>
<LI>No gap exceeding 1510 has been definitively established as a
    first occurrence; larger gaps included in these lists are instead
    first known occurrence prime gaps.
    <A HREF="..\index.html#TPG">Additional lists</A> of first known
    occurrence prime gaps are maintained on this site.</LI>
<LI>The smallest gap whose first occurrence remains uncertain is the
    gap of 1382.</LI>
<LI>The smallest gap for which no occurrence is yet known is the
    gap of 108674.</LI>
<LI>The convention is followed here that the size (or measure) G of a
    prime gap is the difference of its two bounding primes; consequently
    a gap G contains (G&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) consecutive composite
    integers. Some authorities (e.g., J. W. L. Glaisher, Daniel Shanks)
    have taken (G&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) itself as the size of the gap, while
    others (e.g., Richard P. Brent) have specified the size of a gap by
    the parameter r = G/2. Furthermore, some authorities (e.g., Hans
    Riesel, Paul Leyland) have specified a gap by the terminating prime
    p_2, rather than the initiating prime p_1 as employed herein.</LI>
<LI>Note that the term <U>first occurrence prime gap</U> (of measure G)
    refers to that interval p &lt;= x &lt;= p+G for which (1) p and p+G
    are primes, (2) p+t is composite for each integer t=1,...,G-1, and
    (3) no smaller positive prime p possesses these properties. The
    entity might be more accurately described as the earliest or smallest
    occurrence of the gap G, but the terminology <U>first occurrence
    prime gap</U> is well established in the literature. It does
    <U>not</U> imply historical precedence; a gap of equal measure,
    bounded by larger primes, may have been previously known.</LI>
<LI>The term <U>first known occurrence prime gap</U> refers to a
    gap which satisifies conditions (1) and (2) above, but for which
    condition (3) has not been verified; there may exist a gap (at this
    time undiscovered, or at least unknown to me) of the same size at
    some unknown location between the current upper bound of exhaustive
    computation and the listed gap. For prime gap measures whose first
    occurrence is not yet known, first known occurrences serve as upper
    bounds; the current upper limit of exhaustive scans serves as the
    lower bound. <A HREF="..\index.html#TPG">Additional lists</A> of
    first known occurrence prime gaps are maintained on this site; this
    is the only list which contains first occurrence or maximal prime
    gaps. Furthermore, I have written, and made available for download,
    <A HREF="../gaps/td2k.zip">a powerful UBASIC computer code</A>
    designed for the discovery of new first known occurrence prime
    gaps.</LI>
<LI>In these tables, the size or measure of the gap (difference of the
    bounding primes) is shown in the first column (positions 1-6).</LI>
<LI>The second column (positions 7-11) indicates the
    <U>classification</U> of the gap, as explained below.</LI>
<LI>Position 7 will ordinarily be blank. If an asterisk (*)
    should appear, it indicates that the gap is a <U>maximal</U> gap,
    strictly exceeding in measure all the prime gaps preceding it
    (those between consecutive prime numbers smaller in magnitude).
    In this case, it will in addition always be a definite first
    occurrence and certified prime gap.</LI>
<LI>Position 8 is blank.</LI>
<LI>The character in position 9 is the <U>type</U> of the gap; all of
    the gaps in this document are <U>conventional</U> (common, classic,
    standard, regular, ordinary, normal) prime gaps, indicated by the
    letter &quot;C&quot;; in other words, consecutive prime numbers
    differing by the measure of the gap, as defined by conditions (1)
    and (2) alone from the above definition of first occurrence prime
    gaps. This is the default; if the term <U>prime gap</U> is used
    without further qualification or elaboration, it refers to a
    conventional prime gap. Additional lists are anticipated,
    enumerating other types of prime gaps.</LI>
<LI>The character in position 10 indicates the first occurrence status of
    the prime gap. The character &quot;F&quot; signifies that the gap has
    definitely been established (by an exhaustive scan to or beyond
    that point) as a first occurrence prime gap. The character
    &quot;N&quot; signifies that the gap is definitely <U>not</U> a first
    occurrence (a prior occurrence is known, with smaller bounding primes).
    The character &quot;?&quot; signifies that the gap is a first
    <U>known</U> occurrence (no such gap with smaller bounding primes has
    yet been found), but that it is not presently known if it is
    <U>the</U> first occurrence (i.e., whether or not a gap of equal
    measure with smaller bounding primes exists).</LI>
<LI>The character in position 11 indicates whether the bounding
    integers of the gap are <U>certified</U> primes (&quot;C&quot;) or
    <U>probabilistic</U> primes (&quot;P&quot;). The bounding integers of
    <U>certified</U> gaps (also titled confirmed, conclusive,
    deterministic, definite, definitive, or proven) have been
    conclusively proven prime, using trial prime divisors to the square
    root of the prime, or some test such as APRCL2
    (Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely-Cohen-Lenstra-Lenstra) or ECPP. The gap
    is <U>probabilistic</U> (also titled &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;) if the
    bounding integers have only been shown statistically prime (with a
    probability extremely close to one), using, for example, the
    Miller-Rabin test with multiple bases, or the
    <A HREF="../misc/bpsw.html">strong Baillie-PSW primality test</A>.
    For even larger integers (several hundred digits or more),
    probabilistic tests are orders of magnitude faster than deterministic
    tests, but all tests become computationally expensive for primes
    having thousands of digits. I attempt to personally certify the
    endpoint primes of smaller gaps (up to 200 digits), and to verify
    probabilistically (BPSW test) the endpoint integers of gaps up to
    about 10,000 digits. For gaps with more than about 10,000 digits,
    I employ Fermat's Test with base 2 to verify that the endpoint
    integers are either primes or base-2 pseudoprimes.
<P>
    The interior integers of each gap have been certified composite,
    deterministically (by myself, the discoverer, or a third party),
    usually by means of trial divisors, a Fermat test, or a
    Miller-Rabin test. However, if the character in position 11 is a
    &quot;?&quot; (classification code &quot;C??&quot;), the bounding
    integers are probable primes (using at least Fermat's Test, base 2),
    but the interior integers of the gap have <U>not</U> been verified
    all composite to the satisfaction of Thomas R. Nicely; consequently,
    there remains a significant possibility that such a gap may in fact
    be smaller in measure than indicated, due to the as yet undetected
    presence of an interior prime.
<P>
    In all cases, ultimate responsibility for the verification of a gap
    rests with the discoverer(s).</LI>
<LI>The listed discoverers (abbreviation in the third column) and dates
    (year in the fourth column) reflect my best knowledge or estimate.
    If the actual date of discovery is not known, the date of
    publication or the date of the preprint is shown; if this
    is not known, an estimate is given. Some or all of the gaps
    occurring below 1e5 were almost certainly known prior to the
    indicated discovery, and the attribution of some of the other gaps
    below 1e8 is in doubt; for example, Appel and Rosser published
    significant (but incomplete) results for the gaps below 1e8 in 1961,
    the same year that Gruenberger and Armerding published definitive
    results to 104395289 from data generated by Baker and Gruenberger in
    1959. In general, attribution is not provided for certification of
    a gap already established probabilistically; and in any case, the
    discovery date corresponds to the probabilistic verification of
    the gap.</LI>
<LI>The fifth column (positions 26-32) states a so-called <U>figure of
    merit</U> for the gap. This indicates how much larger the gap is
    than the average gap (approximately ln(x), as a consequence of the
    Prime Number Theorem) between primes near that point; the greater
    the merit, the more unusual the gap. The merit is computed as
    G/ln(p_1); variations in use (and at one time employed in these
    tables) include G/ln(p_2) and G/ln((p_1 + p_2)/2), where p_1 and
    p_2 are the initiating and terminating primes of the gap. For all
    but the first few gaps, the differences among these formulas are
    trivial; indeed, if the results are rounded to two decimal places,
    I have found no discrepancies in the resulting values for any gap
    exceeding 112.
<P>
    NOTE: As a general rule, gaps with merits less than 1.00 will not
    be included in these tables. Such gaps would be smaller than the
    average gap in that region.</LI>
<LI>The sixth column in the tables (positions 33-38) indicates the
    number of decimal digits in the initiating prime.</LI>
<LI>The seventh column (positions 41 and beyond) shows the initiating
    prime (smaller bounding integer) of the gap. Due to connection speed
    limitations (56 Kb/sec max), <U>initiating primes longer than 200
    characters are abbreviated</U>; as the lists grow, additional
    restrictions of this nature (such as a minimum acceptable merit)
    may eventually become necessary. Abbreviated primes are shown in the
    form 123456789012345678901234567890..., with a few (usually 25 or more)
    of the most significant digits shown, followed by an ellipsis
    &quot;...&quot;. A file including the complete specifications of
    abbreviated primes, and all recorded first occurrence, maximal,
    and first known occurrence prime gaps, is nearly 20 MB in size, and
    my dialup connection renders it impractical to maintain the
    file online and updated.</LI>
<LI>However, I have made available for download the zipfile
    <A HREF="merits.zip">merits.zip</A>, which contains a text file
    specifying the measure G and the merit M=G/ln(p_1) for all known
    first occurrence and first known occurrence prime gaps. This file
    should be of assistance in determining whether or not some newly
    discovered gap constitutes a new first known occurrence.</LI>

<LI><U><B>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING PRIME GAPS:</B></U>
    If you wish to submit lists of gaps for inclusion in this document,
    please send them as attachments consisting of <U>zipped plain text</U>
    files. <B>Avoid proprietary formats such as Word, WordPerfect, Excel,
    TeX, PDF, or PostScript. Avoid embedding data in formats such as
    &quot;rich text&quot;, HTML, XHTML, or XML. Multimedia submissions
    (video, audio, images, etc.) and social media submissions (Twitter,
    YouTube, Facebook, instant messaging, etc.) will not be accepted.</B>
    Note that word processors and ordinary e-mail will usually destroy any
    formatting, and may corrupt very long lines (127 characters or more).
    Click <A HREF="../email.html">here</A> for my
    <A HREF="../email.html">current e-mail address</A>.
<P>
    Note, however, that if your zipfiles exceed several MB in size,
    it is not advisable to send them as attachments, as you will risk
    mailbox overflow or bounceback, depending on restrictions enforced
    by the e-mail providers. For such large files, furnish instead a
    pointer to a Website from which I can download the file.
<P>
    If possible, use the exact format employed for the gaps in this
    document, with the exception that you <U>must</U> specify the
    initating prime in its entirety, either by use of a simple formula
    (such as 10^999 + 7, using BASIC syntax; the factorial [!] and
    primorial [#] operators are also available) or by the complete
    decimal expansion of the integer. If line continuation is employed,
    use a trailing backslash &quot;\&quot; as the line continuation
    character. Even though the initiating prime may be abbreviated in
    some of the posted listings, complete specifications of the primes
    are necessary for validation of the gaps.
<P>
    As an alternative, you may simply submit your gaps in the form
    of one gap (two entries) per line, gap size first, <U>initiating</U>
    prime p_1 following, separated by two or more spaces:
<H4><PRE>
                        ggggg  ppppppppppppppppppppp
                        ggggg  ppppppppppppppppppppp
                        ggggg  ppppppppppppppppppppp
                        .....  .....................
</PRE></H4>
    with the size of the gap and initiating prime each as an unbroken
    sequence of decimal digits (no commas, decimal points, spaces, or
    other internal grouping symbols embedded within a sequence of digits);
    one gap per line; no other symbols on the line. The initiating prime
    may be specified, as above, by a recognizable expression (e.g.,
    10^999 + 348957 or 2843# - 4759).
<P>
    Be aware that there may be a delay of several days before your
    gaps are posted, while I am combining and processing multiple
    submissions.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="g1m.html#Format">Additional instructions</A> are provided for
    the formatting and submission of gaps of one million or greater (or
